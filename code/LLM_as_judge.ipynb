One historian argues that the primary reason for the fall was the constant pressure from barbarian invasions. Another one believes it was because of economic troubles and overreliance on slave labor. A third one suggests it was due to moral decay and political instability. Each historian needs to provide evidence to support their claims. How would the historian arguing for economic troubles and overreliance on slave labor present their case?\",\n",
    "  \"response_A\": \"The historian arguing that economic troubles and overreliance on slave labor led to the fall of the Roman Empire would say this: The Empire's economy was heavily affected by the devaluation of Roman currency. This currency debasement resulted in rampant inflation, disrupting the stability of the economy. Additionally, the Roman Empire heavily depended on slave labor. This caused unemployment among free citizens because maintaining slaves was cheaper than hiring free citizens. The decline in employment opportunities resulted in economic instability. On top of these, the empire's expansion towards the east made them reliant on imports, like grain from Egypt. This over-dependency on imports caused a trade deficit, which further weakened the economy. As the empire lost territories, maintaining the trade imbalance became difficult, causing economic downfall. Thus, the economic troubles and overreliance on slave labor were among the main reasons for the fall of the Roman Empire.\",\n",
    "  \"response_B\": \"The historian arguing for economic troubles and overreliance on slave labor would present their case citing key economic factors that contributed to the decline of the Roman Empire. Harper (2016) outlined how the devaluation of Roman currency led to inflation, disrupting economic stability. Additionally, Scheidel (2007) emphasized that the overuse of slaves resulted in widespread unemployment among free citizens, destabilizing the economy further. The empire's dependency on grain imports from Egypt, creating a trade deficit as highlighted by Temin (2006), also contributed to the economic decline. Thus, the combination of these factors played a crucial role in the fall of the Roman Empire.\",\n",
    "  \"reference_answer\": \"This argument focuses on the economic troubles and overreliance on slave labor as primary reasons for the fall of the Roman Empire. To start with, one of the significant pieces of evidence is the devaluation of Roman currency. As highlighted by Harper (2016), the empire suffered from severe inflation due to the constant debasement of their currency, making it difficult for the economy to remain stable. Moreover, the overreliance on slave labor also played a detrimental role. As pointed out by Scheidel (2007), the dependence on slaves led to unemployment among free Roman citizens. This is because slaves were significantly cheaper to maintain compared to hiring free citizens, leading to a decline in job opportunities, which in turn resulted in economic instability. Furthermore, the empire's expansion to the east made them highly dependent on imports, for instance, grain from Egypt. As noted by Temin (2006), this created a trade deficit that further weakened the Roman economy. When the empire began to lose its territories, it became increasingly difficult to maintain this trade imbalance, leading to economic decline. In conclusion, it can be argued that the economic troubles, mainly due to the devaluation of currency and overreliance on slave labor, were significant contributing factors to the fall of the Roman Empire. The evidence provided, which includes scholarly references to Harper (2016), Scheidel (2007), and Temin (2006), supports this thesis.\",\n",

    "# Feedback: Both Response A and Response B correctly identify economic troubles and overreliance on slave labor as significant contributing factors to the fall of the Roman Empire. However, Response B is more effective in presenting the historian's argument due to its inclusion of scholarly sources to back up its claims. Specifically, it references works by Harper, Scheidel, and Temin, which adds credibility to the historian's argument and aligns well with the score rubric's emphasis on evidence and citations. While Response A provides a similar argument, it lacks any form of citations or attributions, which lessens the strength of the evidence presented. Therefore, based on the provided rubric, Response B is the superior response due to its use of scholarly evidence to support the historian's claims.\n",
